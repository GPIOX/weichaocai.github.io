I am currently a PhD Candidate at the School of Information, Xiamen University, Xiamen, advised by [Fei Yuan (袁飞)](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/info/1021/24079.htm). From 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting student with the School of Cyber Science and Technology, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, advised by [Chao Huang (黄超)](https://scst.sysu.edu.cn/members/members01/1406808.htm). My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, especially multi-view/multimodal representation learning and anomaly detection.
